## üè¨ Company Overview

AtliQ Hardware(imaginary company) is a rapidly growing electronics company specializing in hardware products, including PC accessories, printers, and more. Over the years, AtliQ has expanded significantly, establishing a strong global presence in key regions such as APAC, North America, Latin America, and the European Union.

The company distributes its products through two primary sales platforms:
- Brick-and-Mortar Stores ‚Äì Partnering with physical retail outlets like Croma and Best Buy.
- E-Commerce Platforms ‚Äì Selling through online giants like Amazon and Flipkart.

Moreover, AtliQ operates through multiple sales channels:
- Retailers ‚Äì Third-party sellers, both online and offline, that stock and sell AtliQ‚Äôs products.
- Direct Stores ‚Äì AtliQ‚Äôs own branded stores, where consumers can purchase directly.
- Distributors ‚Äì In restricted markets like China and South Korea, AtliQ collaborates with large distributors to ensure product availability.

**Note:** AtliQ‚Äôs customers are retailers and distributors, while the consumers are the end users.

## üîé Problem Statement

As a rapidly growing company, AtliQ Hardware's reliance on scattered Excel sheets for analytics has led to inefficient decision-making, resulting in significant losses, particularly during its Latin American expansion. Meanwhile, competitors leveraging advanced data analytics have gained an edge, leaving AtliQ struggling to keep up with outdated methods. To improve transparency in data-driven decisions and stay competitive, AtliQ has launched a data analytics project to enhance decision-making and strategic growth.

## üéØ Project Objective

To develop an intuitive dashboard that delivers actionable insights for finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain teams, along with an executive and key performers view. This will enhance transparency, improve data accessibility, and empower stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions for strategic growth and efficiency.

## üõ¢ Data Overview

AtliQ Hardware has provided two SQL databases and three Excel files for analysis.  

The three Excel files are:
- Operating Expenses
- Targets (available only for FY 2022)
- Market Share (limited to the Personal Computer division)

The two databases contain the following tables:  

- gdb041:
  - Fact tables: fact_forecast_monthly, fact_sales_monthly
  - Dimension tables: dim_customer, dim_market, dim_product

- gdb056:
  - Contains freight_cost, gross_price, manufacturing_cost, post_invoice_deductions, and pre_invoice_deductions

AtliQ‚Äôs fiscal year runs from September to August, and the dataset covers actual sales from September 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021.

**NOTE:** Since this is a bootcamp project, the data files cannot be shared.

## üßπÔ∏è Data Cleaning & Transformation

#### Standardized & Trimmed Data:
- Removed leading and trailing spaces from text fields.
- Standardized naming conventions for consistency.

#### Data Structuring & Optimization:
- Created a dim_date table for better time-based analysis.
- Merged fact_sales_monthly and fact_forecast_monthly into a single table, fact_actual_estimates, to simplify calculations.
- Added calculated fields in fact_actual_estimates using data from relevant tables (e.g., deriving pre-invoice deductions using percentage values from the pre_invoice_deductions table).
- Disabled load for tables that were used to derive calculations in fact_actual_estimates to optimize performance and reduce the Power BI report size.
